# Native experimental Wayland session with Sway and hikari for KISS ðŸŒ¿
```
Vimb, Surfer and Wyeb(Webkit2gtk and Gtk+3) are working very well.
Surf does not work.
Falkon (QT5) works quite well(performance) but crashes now and then + buggy right-click. Ok to use.
Firefox75 works very well. Comes with vaapi support.
There is a launcher with Wayland specific variables.
Mpv can be extended through some scripts to act as an image viewer.
SDL games Crispy Doom, Doomretro and Xonotic working well. Sauerbraten does not work.
Tests done with Intel graphics.
Eudev dependency for Wlroots!
Sway/hikari are build with suid bit. This seems to be commonly used next to elogind, but itÂ´s not considered 100% ideal.  
The capability method got abandoned because of questionable security.
If you have ideas on how to improve the situation, get in touch. 
```

## NoXland
```
NoXland is an approach to ditch as many X dependencies as possible.  
For a graphical base system, at least `libxkbcommon` and `xkeyboard-config` are required.  
For webkit2gtk `libXslt` is needed. Performance is not as good, but ok. Gstreamer is working significantly worse.  
Wyeb and Surfer are working examples. Mpv and VAAPI is no difference.  
More investigation is needed to find out which libraries are required by `mesa` to get a reasonable performance.  
I was not yet able to build gtk+2 without X so no further testing regarding firefox. When this is possible at all.  
*As gtk+2 is only required at build time, it can be removed together with its dependencies afterwards.
```
base + noXland + webkit2gtk + mpv + vaapi + doomretro:   `kiss l | wc -l` ~ `110`
 
## Compatibility variables
```
BEMENU_BACKEND=wayland
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland
MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland-egl
QT_WAYLAND_FORCE_DPI=physical
```

## Wayland communication socket
```
if test -z "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"; then
    export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/${UID}-runtime-dir
    if ! test -d "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"; then
        mkdir "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"
        chmod 0700 "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"
    fi
fi
```

## Migration
```
Starting off a fresh xorg-less KISS, installation *should* be as easy as
'kiss b sway && kiss i sway' without any further intervention.

However when you come over from Xorg KISS, some rebuilds may be rquired
in order to pickup Wayland:
gtk+3, intel-vaapi-driver, libav, mesa, mpv, sdl*, webkit2gtk. Maybe more.
Packages which dont pickup Wayland automtically are added with modified buildfiles.
Make sure to have KMS enabled.
