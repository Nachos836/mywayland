# KISSlinux compatible wayland repository with wlroots and sway. ðŸŒ¿



## Native waylandsession with:
```
Alacritty, Bemenu, Mpv, SDL(Doom) and one of the following browsers.
```
```
Vimb (webkit2gtk and gtk+3)works very well.
Surf doesnt work due the lack of xprop.
Falkon (QT5) works quite well(performance) but crashes now and then + buggy right-click but ok to use.
Firefox 72.0.1 works somehow but I cant force the same hardware acceleration I do in X. Flickery on resizing.
FF is compiled with 'ac_add_options --enable-default-toolkit=cairo-gtk3-wayland' and has to be started with
'MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1 firefox --no-remote'.
```
