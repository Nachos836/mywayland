# Native experimental Wayland session with Sway and Hikari for KISS ðŸŒ¿
```
Vimb (Webkit2gtk and Gtk+3)works very well.
Surf does not work due the lack of Xprop?
Falkon (QT5) works quite well(performance) but crashes now and then + buggy right-click. Ok to use.
Firefox75 works very well. Comes with vaapi support.
There is a launcher with Wayland specific variables.
SDL games Crispy Doom, Doomretro and Xonotic working well. Sauerbraten does not work.
Tests done with Intel graphics.
Eudev dependency for Wlroots!
Sway/Hikari are build with suid bit. This seems to be commonly used next to elogind, but itÂ´s not considered 100% ideal.  
The capability method got abandoned because of questionable security.
If you have ideas on how to improve the situation, get in touch.
```

## Compatibility variables
```
BEMENU_BACKEND=wayland
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland
MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland-egl
QT_WAYLAND_FORCE_DPI=physical
```

## Wayland communication socket
```
if test -z "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"; then
    export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/${UID}-runtime-dir
    if ! test -d "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"; then
        mkdir "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"
        chmod 0700 "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"
    fi
fi
```

## Migration
```
Starting off a fresh xorg-less KISS, installation *should* be as easy as
'kiss b sway && kiss i sway' without any further intervention.

However when you come over from Xorg KISS, some rebuilds may be rquired
in order to pickup Wayland:
gtk+3, intel-vaapi-driver, libav, mesa, mpv, sdl*, webkit2gtk. Maybe more.
Packages which dont pickup Wayland automtically are added with modified buildfiles.
Make sure to have KMS enabled.
```
