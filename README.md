# KISSlinux compatible wayland repository.

## Wlroots + Sway.

- Native waylandsession with:
```
Alacritty, Bemenu, Falkon, SDL 3d and Vimb(webkit2).
```

Vimb works very well.

Falkon works quite well(performance) but crashes now and then + buggy right-click.

Surf doesnt work due the lack of xprop.

Firefox selfcompiled is buggy. I Could just start one time.

Then it is always segfaulting.
